# ♟️ Advanced Chess: Beyond the Board

### Advanced Programming Final Project | Bu-Ali Sina University (BASU)

This repository contains the final project for the **Advanced Programming** course at **Bu-Ali Sina University**. We have developed an **Advanced Chess Engine** that goes beyond the classic rules by introducing **custom pieces** with unique movement patterns, **enhanced gameplay features**, and **multiple game modes** to provide a fresh and challenging strategic experience.

## 🛠️ Evolution Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Engine (In Progress)
- [x] **Logic Framework:** High-performance chess move validation.
- [x] **Piece Architecture:** Implementation of polymorphic custom pieces.
- [x] **Rule Engine:** Support for special moves and game state checks.

### Phase 2: Visual Experience (In Progress)
- [ ] **Raylib Integration:** Migrating from terminal-based output to a GPU-accelerated window.
- [ ] **Dynamic Rendering:** Real-time board and piece drawing with high-quality assets.
- [ ] **Interactive UI:** Implementation of mouse-driven controls and menu systems.

### Phase 3: Polish & Effects (Upcoming)
- [ ] **Fluid Animations:** Smooth interpolation for piece sliding and capture effects.
- [ ] **Audio Feedback:** Spatial sound triggers for checks, captures, and game transitions.
- [ ] **Theming:** Support for multiple board skins and visual modes.
